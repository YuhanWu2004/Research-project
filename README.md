Rocket Model Drafting

To investigate the topic: What's the optimal fin shape for an air-powered rocket, 

I first researched about how does different fin shapes influence the stability and the speed of rockets. 

Then, I used Autodesk Fusion 360 and Open Racket to draft three different designs of different fin-shaped rockets. 

Finally, by 3D-printing and putting together the components, we launched the rocket to experiement.

The three types of rocket are: eliptical fin-shaped rocket, trapezoidal fin-shaped rocket, and clipped delta fin-shaped rocket.

A few short videos that show the process of drafting.

By completing this project, I practiced researching and designing a project that relates to an area that interests me. 

I learned to use drafting techonologies to build models and to test their performances.
